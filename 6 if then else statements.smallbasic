'What use is an application if it only runs at one hour of the day?
If Clock.Hour <= 12 Then
  TextWindow.WriteLine("It is morning")
Else
  TextWindow.WriteLine("It isn't morning")
EndIf
'Next we will make our application slightly better. Notice that the application will
'always run. Another thing I forgot to tell you is that Clock Hour follows 24 hour time.
'So make sure to double-check your code for clock errors.
