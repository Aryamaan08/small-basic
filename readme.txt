Hello!
Welcome to my Small Basic intro. I teach you basic Small Basic commands, etc.
smallbasic.com
Notes:
1) A  variable is like a box with a value inside it. You can take that value outside a box by overwriting it.
eg-
myVar = "Hello"
myVar = "SmallBasic" 'The value is "Hello" no more.
2) You can use * or / for multiplication and division respectively. You may have already known that, but I didn't want to take it for granted.
3) Math is built-in and it lets you do more than just +, -, * and /. You can find the floor or ceiling of a number.
eg-
number = 8.4782
floor = Math.floor(number) 'why is number in parentheses? It is passed as an argument- input that the code can follow, else what will it find the value of?
ceiling = Math.ceiling(number)
TextWindow.WriteLine(floor) 'prints out 8 as it is rounded up.
TextWindow.WriteLine(ceiling) 'prints out 9 as it is rounded down.
There are other math functions, but only ceiling was used in the tutorial. Floor is a counterpart to ceiling, so I included it.
